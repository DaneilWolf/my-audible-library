The Republic’s Foreign Intelligence Bureau is having a hard time keeping up, but they are not without their own dirty tricks.

Sera is still suffering from a mysterious malady that has stolen her voice and her magic. Corin knows that a portion of that is his fault, and he’s determined to fix it. His mother is still off in another country, and there are growing odds that she’s involved with a conspiracy to overthrow the visages.</p> <p>Corin has also been branded with a new magical mark on his right hand - one that even veteran climbers don’t seem to recognize. He’s going to need to figure out how it works, otherwise it could be more of a vulnerability than an asset.</p> <p>Corin still hasn’t finished his first year at Lorian Heights. If he fails his final exams, he’ll be sent off to the military and lose his chance to investigate his brother’s fate. And finally, there’s the issue of enemies.

After all, his only true concerns are about his farm and his family. That’s all he really needs. Everyone else are little better than a resource to be utilized.</p> <p>Unfortunately, things still aren’t what they seem to be. The messages Steve left himself pointed at something beyond their contents. Now, that \"something more\" is about to make contact with him. On top of that, the farm is going to hit capacity eventually.

But when Earth is seized by an ancient race wielding incredibly advanced tech, who transport the entire planet to a new location with twin suns, he finds himself fighting to survive in real life. The human race is declared a contaminant, and the new overlords decree that 90 percent of us will be exterminated. Creatures out of myth and legend are sent to do the killing. Dragons, titans, alien creatures, big and small, all with a hunger for human flesh. Humans who survive the first year will be rewarded.</p> <p>After seeing his family killed in the first week, Allistor leads a small group of survivors in their struggle to stay alive. Not satisfied with simple survival, he strives to make himself and his people stronger. The new \"magic\" RPG system that now governs the planet is something he can work with, and teach others to exploit. Thrust into a leadership position, and with vengeance in his heart, Allistor aims to establish a stronghold, then take the fight to the monsters who seek to enslave his people.</p>","title":"Shadow Sun Survival: Shadow Sun, Book 1","titleShort":"Shadow Sun Survival"},{"added":186,"asin":"B07N6MCG3G","authors":[{"name":"Michael Chatfield","url":"B00WCAOQME"}],"blurb":"The Jukal Empire will not let Emerilia rise peacefully.

War with the Empire to the south is imminent, and there's talk of the city's adventurers being drafted into the campaign. Though this conflict seems inevitable and promises to be horrific, the common folk can do little but act like there's nothing wrong. Rather than lose sleep over something so wildly out of their control, they instead worry about tiny, personal, inconsequential issues. Things like, \"Will the butcher have fresh steak today?\" and, \"Should I get those new boots now, or wait and see if they go on sale?\"</p> <p>However, though they try to maintain some modicum of normalcy, the people of Azurvale have yet to find out that their capital is already under threat. Not by some warmongering nation, but by a certain individual that has come to them seeking asylum, knowledge, profit, and power through any means necessary. As this newcomer burrows into the city's underbelly like a voracious tick, it cares not for the people it hurts along the way. Indeed, any soul unfortunate enough to cross paths with Boxxy T. Morningwood seems doomed to have their life ruined in one way or another. Often through no fault of their own.</p> <p>Whether it's an ancient being, a skilled assassin, a godlike archer, or a fresh-faced recruit, none shall be spared from the whims of chaos.</p> <p>Content warning: Profanity, gore, violence, explicit adult content.</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater Team for this production:</p> <ul> <li>Jeff Hays - narration, sound design</li> <li>Annie Ellicott - Keira, Rowana, the Dryads, and the rest of the new female cast&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - editing and proofing</li> <li>Ahmed Mahmoud - editing, music, sound design, and mastering</li> </ul>","title":"Morgana: Everybody Loves Large Chests, Book 4","titleShort":"Morgana"},{"added":165,"asin":"B079G8CZ9M","authors":[{"name":"Michael Chatfield","url":"B00WCAOQME"}],"blurb":"Alliances and enemies are made, but the Stone Raiders keep their promise.

Chosen by the gods of another world, Cerys finds herself trapped between warring factions: a tyrannical human empire and an oppressed kingdom of demons.</p> <p>When she discovers her best friend has been dragged into this new world as well, Cerys is forced to choose between saving her friend or looking at the bigger picture. If Cerys is to be anything more than a pawn in the gods' game, she'll have to leverage everything she's learned on her home world and in past games, before it's too late. With a cocky incubus king vying for more than her loyalty, her quest won’t be an easy one.</p> <p>The Deck of Souls series contains some dark themes, profanity, violence, and adult relationships. <br> <br> The Soundbooth Theater Crew for this production:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Annie Ellicott - Narration</li> <li>Jeff Hays - Idris Bloodsong</li> <li>Justin Thomas James - Emrys, Meical, and the rest of the male cast&nbsp;</li> <li>Laurie Catherine Winkel - Corlyotir, Drysi, and the rest of the female cast</li> <li>Griffin Malnar - Editing, Mastering, Sound Design</li> <li>Ahmed Mahmoud - Music</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - Project Manager, Proofing</li> <li>Bonnie L.

Basically, this ex-succubus comes along, ropes me into a whole ordeal that involves fighting off her old team of supervillains or aliens, whatever you want to call them.</p> <p>Just the two of us? No way in hell! We had to form a team first, and what a team!</p> <p>But I won't spoil the fun for you, friend. Listen on.

It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese.&nbsp;</p> <p>For six months things went well: He found a quaint little shop, he befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and, best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins - gurvani, they call themselves - bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy - and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: to hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: there are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you'll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker's son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger.&nbsp;</p>","title":"Spellmonger: Spellmonger, Book 1","titleShort":"Spellmonger"},{"added":67,"asin":"B07S5H29H3","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Johns","url":"B07MY9QX3K"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"19378253031"},{"name":"Classics","url":"19378271031"}],"cover":"51djNG9CAqL","dateAdded":"03/05/2020","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"16h 18m ","narrators":[{"name":"B.

He was exploring one of those very worlds when the planet that he actually inhabited became suddenly, and drastically more interesting.</p> <p>The ability to shapeshift into a house cat or summon a demon to serve him were things that were only possible in video games and epic fantasy novels, until they weren't. He may not have had the luxury of a controller or mouse to explore his new abilities, but Garath's dream came true when Earth was fundamentally altered. More akin now to the RPG games that he loved so much than the 9-5 grind he'd woken up to that morning. He's a quick study, though, and learns quickly that this new Earth isn't just fun and games.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tutorial kills everybody.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well not everybody. Almost everybody. Garath and a motley crew of friends and neighbors band together to survive. They are forced to work together using their new abilities to hold off the increasingly deadly waves of monsters.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Peril's Prodigy series features 30 unique Classes, a human racial ability to shapeshift, character leveling, some things you really just can't un-hear, and a look into the future of this new Earth. It will make you laugh. It will make you cringe. And if you're anything like Garath, it'll make you wonder where in the hell on this new video game Earth were all the god damn hot elves?</p> <p>***Full disclosure: This is not a harem novel. There are no hot elves.</p>","title":"The Culling of Man: A LitRPG Apocalypse (Peril's Prodigy, Book 1)","titleShort":"The Culling of Man"},{"added":47,"asin":"B0848X1L3X","authors":[{"name":"Aaron Holloway","url":"B07X6PCW7K"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"19378253031"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"19378254031"}],"cover":"51LzwSk3scL","dateAdded":"05/02/2020","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"19h 0m ","narrators":[{"name":"Christian J.

A gamer and a bit of a nerd, Sean's philosophy in life has been to keep his head down and get his work done: He doesn't have the time or money for anything more after his father died in an industrial accident when Sean was eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But when a failed kidnapping attempt leaves him with a gaping hole in his memory, his oldest friend dead, and his mother missing, Sean suddenly finds his whole world turned upside down as he's thrust into the hidden world of magic and the supernatural. Apparently he's now wanted, dead or alive, by all of the magical societies, though he has no idea why.

To make matters even more difficult, the very same magic users who had Sean's father killed now believe that Sean will somehow inherit his father's work when he turns 21, which is just a few days away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Needless to say most of the magic users' councils seem to be in two camps: The first camp wants him dead. The second camp wants him captured and will probably kill him after they've learned his secrets. The only solution Sean sees to any of this is to finish his father's work, the very thing that got his father killed. But in order to do that, Sean must first find out just what his father was working on! He's also going to need to learn magic himself, find a safe place to stay, raise some money, and gain a lot of allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately for Sean he's got two good women at his side: Roxy, a cheetah lycanthrope with a lot of experience in fighting; and Jolene, a tantric witch with more than a few connections in the supernatural black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>WARNING: <i>The Valens Legacy</i> contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, bad language, attempted murder, actual murder, self-defense, proactive self-defense, destruction of private property, vandalism, breaking and entering, tantric magic, polyamory, mayhem, gratuitous sex and violence, littering, breaking speed limits, a used car dealer, one Plymouth hemi, and some poor guy who just wants to earn a paycheck as a cashier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 1: The Valens Legacy, Books 1-2","titleShort":"The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 1"},{"added":17,"asin":"B07D3ZXCCP","authors":[{"name":"Jeff Wheeler","url":"B004SBCEK6"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"19378442031"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"19378443031"}],"cover":"61WPLnwKwxL","dateAdded":"08/06/2018","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"11h 43m ","narrators":[{"name":"Kate Rudd"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07FYM2R74","authors":"S.

The only spell he can safely cast is Enhance Intelligence, which boosts his IQ for a fraction of a second before the curse drains it all away again.</p> <p>Normally casting such a spell would be pointless, but Sorch's tribe has found a way to benefit. Magic that is cast near a mysterious artefact called the ‘Voodoo Engine’ causes invisible hands to appear, and these hands get work done for his tribe. Sorch is a slave to the Voodoo Engine, casting a single spell over and over again to avoid being beaten by the chief’s warrior caste.</p> <p>While foraging for food on one fateful night, our hero happens upon two human mages who are in big trouble. He saves their lives, and in return they give him an amulet that will make his life easier. Unbeknownst to the humans, their gift grants Sorch the power to break the cycle of intelligence drain and physical abuse. With the help of his friend and mentor, Shaman, Sorch becomes a real mage.</p> <p>Sorch leaves his swamp and embarks on a series of incredibly exciting and dangerous adventures. During his travels he encounters horrible injury, magical treasures, love, snow, university admissions tests, a plot against the Kingdom, and then of course he saves the world. Or does he?</p> <p>Be prepared to rethink everything you know about thinking.

As the sun sets, people have no choice but to take shelter behind magical wards and pray that their protection holds until the creatures dissolve with the first signs of dawn. </p> <p>When Arlen's life is shattered by the demon plague, he is forced to see that it is fear, rather than the demons, which truly cripples humanity. Believing that there is more to his world than to live in constant fear, he must risk leaving the safety of his wards to discover a different path.In the small town of Cutter's Hollow, Leesha's perfect future is destroyed by betrayal and a simple lie. Publicly shamed, she is reduced to gathering herbs and tending an old woman more fearsome than the corelings. Yet in her disgrace, she becomes the guardian of dangerous ancient knowledge. </p> <p>Orphaned and crippled in a demon attack, young Rojer takes solace in mastering the musical arts of a Jongleur, only to learn that his unique talent gives him unexpected power over the night.Together, these three young people will offer humanity a last, fleeting chance of survival.</p>","title":"The Painted Man: The Demon Cycle, Book 1","titleShort":"The Painted Man"},{"added":5,"asin":"B079J77656","authors":[{"name":"Christopher G.
